<P>
The socket is more versatile than other communication mechanisms
because it can operate either host-locally (in unix domain) or
network-widely (in internet domain).
Connection-oriented socket (SOCK_STREAM) and
unconnected socket (SOCK_DGRAM) are supported.
In both cases,
you must first create a socket address object
by <B>make-socket-address</B> function,
which returns an instance of <TT>socket-address</TT>.
In unix domain, a socket address is specified by a path-name
in the unix file system.
In internet domain, the address is specified by combining
the host machine name, the port number, and optionally the protocol number.
If the port number is defined in <TT>/etc/services</TT>, it can be referred through
the symbol specified by the service name.
The function <B>unix:getservbyname</B> can be used 
to retrieve the port number from the symbolic service name.
Port numbers less than 1024 are reserved for root users,
and non-priviledged users are advised to use port numbers greater than 1024 
for their private sockets.
<P>
Although connected streams provide bidirectional communication channels,
the connection establishment operation is asymmetric.
One endpoint is refered
to server and other to client.
The endpoint on the behalf of the server
(service access point) must be first established.
It is created by <B>make-socket-port</B> function which returns an instance
of <TT>socket-port</TT>.
The socket-port object is then used to accept connections from
one or more clients by <B>make-server-socket-stream</B>.
A call to <B>make-server-socket-stream</B> may be blocked
until a connection request from a client really happens.
Clients can make socket streams by
<B>make-client-socket-stream</B> specifying a socket-address.
<P>
<PRE>;;; an example of IPC through a socket stream:
;;; server side
(setq saddr  (make-socket-address :domain af_inet :host &quot;etlic2&quot; :port 2000))
(setq sport  (make-socket-port saddr))
(setq sstream (make-server-socket-stream sport))
;;;
;;; client side
(setq caddr (make-socket-address :domain af_inet :host &quot;etlic2&quot; :port 2000))
(setq cstream (make-client-socket-stream caddr))</PRE>
<P>
In applications like a database or an environment simulator for mobile
robots, <EM>multiple connection service</EM>
between one server and many clients is required.
This type of server can be programmed by the <B>open-server</B> function.
From the current host name and given port number,
<B>open-server</B> creates a socket port (service access point)
on which connection requests are listened for.
Since this port is attributed to be asynchronous,
<B>open-server</B> is not blocked and returns immediately.
Thereafter, each connection request interrupts EusLisp's main loop,
and an socket-stream is created asynchronously.
This socket-stream also works in asynchronous mode:
the asynchronous input processing function which is the second argument
to <B>open-server</B> is invoked whenever new data appear in this stream.
Up to 30 connections can be established so that
as many clients can access the server's data at the same time.
<P>
<PRE>;; server side
(defun server-func (s) 
   (case (read s) ...    ;do appropriate jobs according to inputs
(open-server 3000 #'server-func)
... do other jobs in parallel
;; client-1 through client-N
(setq s (connect-server &quot;etlmmd&quot; 3000))
(format s &quot;...&quot; ...) (finish-output s)	;issue a command to the server
(read s)                                ;receive response</PRE>
<P>
In contrast to the <I>connection-oriented</I> streams which provide reliable
communication channels,
the <I>connectionless</I> sockets are unreliable: messages may be lost,
duplicated, and may arrive out-of-order.
The <I>connectionless</I> sockets, however, have advantages that they
do not need to assign file descriptor to each connection,
and sending process is never blocked even if the receiver is not
reading data and the buffer overflows.
<P>
To make connectionless sockets, use the following procedures.
Messages are transferred by the <B>unix:sendto</B> and <B>unix:recvfrom</B>.
<PRE>;;; receiver side
(setq saddr  (make-socket-address :domain af_inet :host &quot;etlic2&quot; :port 2001))
(setq sock   (make-dgram-socket saddr))
(unix:recvfrom sock)
;;;
;;; client side
(setq caddr (make-socket-address :domain af_inet :host &quot;etlic2&quot; :port 2001))
(setq sock (unix:socket (send caddr :domain) 2 0))
(unix:sendto sock caddr &quot;this is a message&quot;)
;;;
;;; how to use echo service which is registered in /etc/services.
(setq caddr (make-socket-address :domain af_inet :host &quot;etlic2&quot;
                                 :port (car (unix:getservbyname &quot;echo&quot;))))
(setq echosock (unix:socket (send caddr :domain) 2 0))
(unix:sendto echosock caddr &quot;this is a message&quot;)
(unix:recvfrom echosock)  --&gt; &quot;this is a message&quot;</PRE>
