<P>
In order for Solaris to execute a program in parallel on many
processors, the program needs to be written as a collection
of functions, each of which is executed by a thread dynamically
created in a process.  Although the time required for thread
creation is faster than process creation, it takes a few
mili-seconds for EusLisp to start off a thread after allocating
stacks and setting a page attribute for detecting stack-overflow.
Since this delay, which should be compared to a function invocation,
is intolerable, sufficient number of threads are created by
the <TT>make-thread</TT> function beforehand and put in 
the system's thread pool,
eliminating the need for system calls at evaluation time.
Each thread in the thread pool is represented by a thread object,
as depicted in Fig.<A HREF="node94.html#threadobj">7</A>,
consisted of thread-id, several semaphores for synchronization,
and slots for argument and evaluation result transfer.
